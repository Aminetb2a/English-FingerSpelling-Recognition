Sign language recognition is important for natural and convenient communication between deaf
community and hearing majority.
We take the initial step of automatic fingerspelling system using Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We train SVMs, and CNNs for the classification of 24
alphabets (excluding J and Z). Given the limitations of the datasets and the encouraging results achieved,
we are confident that with further research and more data, we can produce a fully generalizable
translator for all ASL letters.
